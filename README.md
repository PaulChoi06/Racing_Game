This game is a typical racing game.
This was a prototype version, as my main objective was to get introduced to bots and their movement.

The bot has some bugs and there is only 1 level.

MECHANICS:

Use WASD to move your car.
Press space to boost.

Bot uses constraints to move around.
This means it can not go through a certain range of coordinates on the window.

OBJECTIVE:

Drive side to side to avoid hitting the stop signs.

Try to beat the bot to the end.


NOTE:

This game is just a prototype and it is not as good as it can be, but right now I need to study more about bots in programming.
